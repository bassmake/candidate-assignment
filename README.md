@startuml;
Command -> Entity: ask to do something;
Entity -> Entity: validates, creates events\n(not stored yet);
Entity -> Journal: stores events;

### Asynchronous processing

## Technical requirements

* Unit tests
* Integration tests - this means that whole application is running including in-memory DB

### Bonus points

* Domain Driven Design applied
* Multi-module approach with [clean architecture](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/a-quick-introduction-to-clean-architecture-990c014448d2)
* Generated API documentation
* Automated DB migrations ([Liquibase](https://www.liquibase.org/) or [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/))
* Security layer with basic auth
* Security layer with JWT
* Building runnable fat-jar
